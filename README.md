# Schedulers-in-Embedded-Systems
This project gets an input.txt file each line of which contains a scheduling problem. Each problem contains 3 lists separated by semicolon. These lists are periods, number of jobs, and deadlines of jobs. In the output, there is a .txt file with the solution to each problem in each line. Each solution contains "the number of jobs"+1 lists separated by semicolon. The first "the number of jobs" lists shows the moments in which the job is going to be done. the last list contains the missed jobs. There is going to be a graph which shows the process as well. The schedulers are RM, DM, and EDF. Also the RM scheduler supports one interrupt driven aperiodic task. The output of this version contains an additional list in the end for the aperiodic task. The project also contains an RM polling server with 3rd-priority aperiodic tasks.
